# About

Python notebook files (ipynb) used to create the figures (inc. supplementary figures) in the text "How early can an upcoming critical transition be detected?"


# How to use

First run each detection method and ensure the output has been saved to `data/results/<detection method>/`

To create the figures, install Jupyter Notebook and interactivly follow each `.ipynb`.

`AUC_best_consecutive.ipynb` can only be run after the other notebooks, as it uses data saved in these files.
